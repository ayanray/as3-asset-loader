================

With Actionscript 3, it is difficult to manage all the different types of loading for Sound, XML, Video, Images, and SWF's. The new system is more organized and makes more sense, but becomes more complicated when developing. That is why the AssetLoader Class has been created. 

The AssetLoader Class aims to make a simple developer interface to load pictures, videos, sound, xml, AV1 SWF and AV2 SWFs. It uses simple object notation and is easily extendable by the developer.
